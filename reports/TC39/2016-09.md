# TC39 Meeting on September 2016

The last TC39 Meeting was hosted by Netflix in Los Gatos, USA.

You can find [the agenda here](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2016/09.md) and check we addressed almost all of the items previewed for this meeting.

Before moving forward, I'd like to repeat the same statement from [my first report](https://github.com/jquery-foundation/standards/blob/master/reports/TC39/2016-05.md):

> As this report is not the meeting notes, I'll run through the highlights in an order differently than they happened, prioritizing what I believe to be the more interesting, polemic or in need of more discussion. Remember that's subjective, and there's no irrelevant items.

## ECMA-414

When we say ECMAScript, we are usually referring to the core language specification on ECMA-262, but it's just part of the ECMAScript Suite, the ECMA-414.

TC39 approved an update for [ECMA-414](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2016/tc39-2016-039.pdf) which scopes:

- ECMA-262 The ECMASCript language specification
- ECMA-402 The Internationalization API specs
- ECMA-404 The JSON format
- ECMA TR/104 The ECMAScript Test Suite, which is an informative reference to [test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262)

They are short and pretty much work as references to the other specs, but I'm glad to say I wrote several parts of this [TR/104](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/master/Draft%20TR%20ECMA-104%202nd%20edition.doc) (Technical Report n. 104).

## NodeJS and TC39 goes to a bar...

We've finally had a comprehensive integration with NodeJS. ES Modules is one of the most anticipated features for web developers. Having NodeJS and TC39 to get in sync together couldn't be better.

[James Snell](https://twitter.com/jasnell) wrote a [great report](https://hackernoon.com/node-js-tc-39-and-modules-a1118aecf95e#.xr5fw2ay5) about the conversation we've had on this meeting about Modules. That was super important to identify concerning points to integrate Node's CommonJS Modules and ES Modules.

You can also find this excelent [follow up article](https://medium.com/@awbjs/follow-up-tc39-meets-node-js-modules-76fdea278370#.887tk8dj0) from [Allen Wirfs-Brock](https://twitter.com/awbjs).

### ...NodeJS and TC39 talks about Modules

You can check the [meeting notes here](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-28.md#es-modules-lifecycle). Spoiler: it was a long conversation.

One of the most asked questions from the community is when we'll have the `.mjs` extension or not. Apparently, NodeJS is still inclined to do it. Personally, I'm in a moment that I just want to have ES Modules in Node and I want to help them getting it implemented.

I've had some extra conversations with [Bradley Farias](https://twitter.com/bradleymeck) - the NodeJS hero behind the ES Modules - and showed him [all the tests we have on test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/master/test/language/module-code) for Module code. The tests cover some unique - [and some bizarre](https://bocoup.com/weblog/test262-is-a-javascript-sideshow) - details for the module syntax.

### import()

In the same time, we are discussing about an `import()` syntax to work both on scripts and browsers. It's a WIP proposal, so ~~it's not even in the stage process~~ it was early to advance it in the stage process. You can follow the [work here](https://github.com/domenic/proposal-import-function) and the [notes here](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-28.md#113a-import).

#### Post-release notes:

`import()` is on stage 2. I've got it wrong and thought it was not on the stage process. My bad we have a lot of different proposals and lots of topics on every meeting and I wasn't able to see this one before.

### Built-in Modules on Stage 1

One great thing I'm looking forward for JS is the Built-in Modules feature.

Brian Terlson brought [this proposal](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11ivc-built-in-modules---lets-pick-a-syntax) which would allow us to load built-in modules instead of just filling the global with more and more names. Built-in modules can be composed by cases like DateTime - as a desirable fixed object for Date - and [SIMD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SIMD).

The syntax could also be used by implementation specific built-ins, like `fs` in Node and Web APIs.

It's on Stage 1, but still need a good definition for its syntax. My favorite is `import Name` as it can be used as:

```js
import DateTime;
import SIMD;
import BluetoothAPI;
```

You probably have an opinion about it, so take a look [at the notes](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11ivc-built-in-modules---lets-pick-a-syntax) and [this thread](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/395).

## `global` is now on Stage 3

Jordan Harband has finally got [`global` to stage 3](http://tc39.github.io/proposal-global/). That means implementations are on their way to implement it and there's a reasonable chance to have it landing on the ES2017.

No more iife functions or global `this` to catch global object, and finally a cross-compatible name to avoid using DOM's `window`.

## Rest/Spread Properties on Stage 3

I'm glad this feature proposal from Sebastian Markbage is moving forward. Working on transpiled WebApps I always find myself using it.

If you're not familiar yet to it, you can should check the examples from [the proposal](http://sebmarkbage.github.io/ecmascript-rest-spread/):

Rest Properties:

```js
let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
x; // 1
y; // 2
z; // { a: 3, b: 4 }
```

Spread properties:

```js
let n = { x, y, ...z };
n; // { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 }
```

Those are time savers and I hope goes to Stage 4 for ES2017 as well. Meanwhile, we'll need to have this on test262 and I'm looking forward to work on those tests, even if it's only reviewing.

## Async iteration on Stage 3

Domenic Denicola is now championing [this proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration) created by Kevin Smith - a former invited expert of the jQuery Foundation. With some issues fixed, it's finally on Stage 3. Prepare yourselves for what comes _next_, and _then_ you check the _value_ of it while it's not _done_ yet. _I'm a terrible comedian_.

In case you're not familiar with async iterations, it's basically a way to create async iterators that return a promise instead of sync objects. This example from the proposal ilustrates the difference from a sync and an async iterators very well:

```js
const { value, done } = syncIterator.next();

asyncIterator.next().then(({ value, done }) => /* ... */);
```

This proposal also features a `for-await-of` loop. Which is wicked amazing:

```js
for await (const line of readLines(filePath)) {
  console.log(line);
}
```

It does not end there, take a look at the async generator functions to be consumed by the `for-await-of` loops!

```js
async function* readLines(path) {
  let file = await fileOpen(path);

  try {
    while (!file.EOF) {
      yield await file.readLine();
    }
  } finally {
    await file.close();
  }
}
```

You can try it today in many different ways, I recommend you take a look at the [current implementation status section](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration#implementation-status) of this proposal.

Checkout the [meeting notes here](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11iiib-async-iteration).

## No more `arguments.caller`

Brian Terlson faced no conflict to [remove this](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/689) from the specs. We got rid of this _needless poison pill_. This is [not implemented in browsers](http://jsbin.com/vajijoludo/edit?js,console) anymore so there's no need to standardize this bad API.

## Generator arrow functions on Stage 1

We have async arrow functions, but no generator arrow functions. That would be useful for hacking `this` uses on specific scopes in cases we need a generator.

I invite you to [take a look](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-27.md#11ic-generator-arrow-functions) at [the notes](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#arrow-generator-revisit) and [help on ideas](https://github.com/jquery-foundation/standards/issues). How `=*>` or `=>*` would sould strange to you?

## `of` and `from` methods for Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet on Stage 1

I proposed this [new API feature in this meeting](https://github.com/leobalter/proposal-setmap-offrom). It was [not very well accepted](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11iic-set-map-weakset-and-weakmap-of-and-from-methods) but it's on stage 1. That means I'll need to provide more information on the utilify for this feature.

This proposal ships `of` and `from` methods for the Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet constructors. The main reason is allowing creating instances in a proper pattern for collections. This also helps creating polymorphic APIs.

`of` and `from` were introduced on `Array` and they are also present on `TypedArray` constructors, mostly because the Array constructor has different handlings given the provided arguments. A `new Array(42)` creates an instance with 42 undefined items, `new Array('42')` creates `['42']`, and `new Array(42, 43)` creates `[42, 43]`.

In the case of Map, one of my own motivations was remembering the struggles I faced when I wrote some tests for Map on test262:

```js
new Map( [ [ 42, 43 ], [ [ 44 ], 45 ] ] ); // Map {42 => 43, [44] => 45}
```

This is not welcoming, and I saw myself many times missing an iterable, or wishing I could just use the `.set` method instead:

```js
var map = new Map();
map.set( 42, 43 );
map.set( [ 44 ], 45 );
```

The regular Map constructor iterates over the first - and single - argument   A `Map.of` would create the same with a list of arguments instead of that single iterable:

```js
Map.of( [ 42, 43 ], [ [ 44 ], 45 ] ); // Map {42 => 43, [44] => 45}
```

This might solve some issues for false positives when missing the first iterable but providing some iterable value, as strings when creating instances of Set:


```js
new Set( [ "Leo", "Balter" ] ); // Set {"Leo", "Balter"}

// False positive on strings:
new Set( "Leo", "Balter" ); // Set {"L", "e", "o"}

// False positive with other iterable objects:
new Set( [42], [43] ); // Set {42}, instead of Set {42, 43}
```

The `from` method is there for symmetry.

If this is still not confusing, I have to mention that Brendan Eich also came with a similar problem using set:

```js
Reflect.construct(Array, [1,2,3]) // [ 1, 2, 3 ]

Reflect.construct(Set, [1,2,3]) // TypeError (missing an extra iterable over the arguments)
```

You can find more data in [this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/771009446298329088).

Hopefully I can move this forward in the next meeting, but I would be very happy to [know your opinions about it](https://github.com/leobalter/proposal-setmap-offrom/issues).

## RegExp everywhere!

### Legacy RegExp features on Stage 2

Do you know ECMAScript has an [Annex B](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers) documenting features for web browsers? Most of it is describing legacy features from browsers implementations that are normally undesirable but the specs still have it for a proper interoperable implementations.

Some of these features includes the infamous [`__proto__`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-object.prototype.__proto__) and even the funny [`String.prototype.blink`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-string.prototype.blink).

Claude Pache [identified some of these legacy deprecated features on RegExp](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-legacy-features) and now we have a Stage 2 proposal to specify them.

For better or worse, it's great to different browsers acting equally even on deprecated features.

### Named Capture Groups on Stage 1

Daniel Ehrenberg presented this [proposal for named captured groups](https://github.com/littledan/es-regexp-named-groups) on Regular Expressions.

This means we might extend RegExps with named capture groups and I'm pretty excited this features a syntax already consistent with other languages.

This would be pretty interesting:

```js
let re = /(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/;
let result = '2015-01-02'.replace(re, '$<day>/$<month>/$<year>');
```

### Unicode property escapes on Stage 2

Daniel Ehrenberg and Brian Terlson are championing [this proposal](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/es-regexp-unicode-property-escapes) from Mathias Bynens.

It's another amazing feature as it would provide us a way to access Unicode character properties in RegExps.

We are on a way to implement something like:

```js
const regexGreekSymbol = /\p{Script=Greek}/u;
regexGreekSymbol.test('π');
// → true
```

It will hopefully move to stage 3 soon.

## Proposals not advancing for now

### Cancellable Promises

This is a proposal that needs [some comprehensive discussions](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11ivb-cancelable-promises) as it will ship some syntax changes we can't regret later.

I've heard from other WebDev friends they agree or disagree with parts of this proposal. I believe the best possible thing is to follow the discussion on the [issues page for this propossal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancelable-promises) before it goes to Stage 3 - hopefully soon.

The notes for this discussion shows TC39 is able to have fun sometimes:

```
DD: I don't like mics

MS: What's wrong with Mikes?
```

### Observables

The same goes to [Observables](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11iiic-observables). It needs more discussion, but meetings are also made to improve features, not only advancing.

### Sigil swap: decorators <-> private fields

Jordan Harband [proposed a change for the current proposals](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es7/2016-09/sept-29.md#11iid-sigil-swap-decorators---private-fields) of decorators and private fields to replace their sigils.

That would mean decorators would use `#` while private fields would use `@`. It makes total sense, but we've got a problem: there's already a lot of developers writing transpiled webapps - ESNext w/ Babel and TypeScript. Changing these sigils would break all of them so it is a win for the early adopted syntax to prevail.

Our desired future world of JS is made of imperfections, and the frustrations need to be the smallest to move the web forward.

While I would love this replacement, I don't want to break webapps around. It's important to have early adopters and have their trust around.

__It's also important to mention that the committee explicitly is not setting a precedent that existing transpiled syntax is set in stone__ - ie: that decorators are a special case.

The Decorators proposal is in progress for more than 2 years, and the most important here is that we find a closure for this, shipping into implementations for a better JS ecossystem.


## Conclusion

I've noticed how perfect is the care of TC39 on the syntax. Extending the syntax is a precise job we cannot regret later and we should do our best to avoid bad choices. Some meetings may feel exaustive but in the end, we know we are doing a great job to have JS a great language for decades.

There's a lot of interesting points I mentioned here, and I'm sure I didn't cover all of them in this report. Take some time to read [the meeting notes](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/tree/master/es7/2016-09), you'll probably find something interesting and I would [really enjoy to discuss it](https://github.com/jquery-foundation/standards/issues).

What are you expecting for the next meetings? We have other 2 meetings before we close release candidate for ES2017, the next is [November](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2016/11.md).

I'm looking forward to see Decorators, Private Fields and Public Fields moving forward in the stage process. Let's see if this will happen in the next meeting.
